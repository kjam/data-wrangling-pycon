On May 15 2014 the National Accounts were rebased from 2005 to 2010. In addition, concepts underpinning the computation of accounts have been substantially modified in compliance with the new European System of Accounts (ESA, 2010). One important methodological change affects the computation of R&D expenditures as an investment (previously registered as intermediate consumption) which results in a substantial revision in the GDP level.

United States	General government revenue	National currency	Billions	Source: BEA and IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (revenue, expenditure, and net lending); Flow of Funds (debt) Latest actual data: 2013 Notes: Revenue, expenditure, and net lending data are compiled according to the GFSM2001 methodology. Due to data limitations, most series begin 2001. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the January 2015 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for the IMF staff?s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline incorporates the key provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, including a partial rollback of the sequester spending cuts in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The rollback is fully offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. In fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the IMF staff assumes that the sequester cuts will continue to be partially replaced, in portions similar to those agreed upon under the Bipartisan Budget Act for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, with back-loaded measures generating savings in mandatory programs and additional revenues. Over the medium term, the IMF staff assumes that war drawdown will continue and Congress will continue to make regular adjustments to Medicare payments (DocFix) and will extend certain traditional programs (such as the research and development tax credit). The fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff?s forecasts of key macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of defined benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis.
